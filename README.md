## ðŸ‘€ Shamelessly inspired by...
https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile

## ðŸŽ¨ Things that I changed...
- added Scoop to suppliment Choco package manager (WinGet is ðŸ’©)
- changed Oh My Posh & Nerd Font installation to Scoop instead of Choco
- added my prefered Powershell modules
- changed font to Mononoki
- use my profile instead of his (duh)
