## 🎨 Shamelessly inspired by...
https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile

Things that I changed...
- added Scoop installation to suppliment Choco store
- changed oh-my-posh installation to Scoop instead of Choco
- added my prefered Powershell modules
- changed font to Mononoki
- use my profile instead of his (duh)
